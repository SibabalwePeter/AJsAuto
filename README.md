# AJsAuto(The project is still in progress)

The requirement is to develop a web application through which prospective users can schedule, reschedule or cancel particular services for their vehicle. 
 
The main deliverables of the system are: 
 
1. Upon receiving confirmation of the account creation, via e-mail, the client/user needs to be able to login to the portal request possible appointment dates based on technician availability and type of service and type of service - Taking into account the service types offered per technician based on seniority. E.g. A junior technician can perform 3 service types vs a senior technician who can perform 8 service types. 
 
2. The system should send an e-mail notification to the client confirming the booking - the e-mail should contain a link to the portal (Login page).  
 
3. Client should be able to cancel or reschedule bookings based on availability. 
 
4. Security - Simple Username and password. Client should receive an e-mail with username and password once they are registered by the admin user. 
 
The main technologies that are involved include, (but aren’t limited to): - Database (more than one table, i.e. users, technicians, services) (SQL Server) - Web API (ASP .Net Core - EntityFramework to interact with the DB) - React front-end (Typescript) - Mailing Service (E.g. Send Grid) 
 
These are the main aspects of the project – in terms of design (to be delivered in the next 5 days – 9 April to 15 April COB): 
 
 Solution Design (Diagrammatic form - High level technical design: How the different technologies relate to each other within the system).  Data Model Design (Database)  UI Design (Mockup) - Login - Enter details of the appointment and view available time slots 

- Book appointment.  - View current or past appointments and be able to cancel or reschedule upcoming appointments  Admin page (e.g. Login as admin and be redirected to admin page) - Sign up users (Users get an e-mail containing their username and password)  Planned Development effort breakdown.
